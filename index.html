    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <!-- paragraphs -->
    <p> My name is Ayesha Suliman, 22 years of age. A driven person who is
        passionate about learning new things that spark my interest. I enjoy taking
        up new hobbies and keeping myself occupied. 
    </p>

    <p> I am currently tutoring children from home. At the end of 2021 I worked as a temp
        at a law firm doing admin/ receptionist work which helped me realise that I want to study
        Software Engineering and possibly Computer Sciences. 
        I have also completed my degree in Bcom Information Management.
    </p>

    <p> My happiness comes from my passion to help people. I like to do things that will bring abit of 
        a challenge to me since I will always be learning something new from any experiences.
        I feel motivated when I start to see positive changes in my life and when the people around me are happy.
        My biggest motivation is having power to change things and having harmony in my life.
    </p>
